		Implementation of Knapsack Problem in python.


about the problem  :analogy :->  Suppose you are in  a restaurants and you have a calorie budget and want take appropriate amount of food to complete that.
But you also have some foods that you like more than other foods.

and you want to order food in such a way that , your calorie requirment is fulfilled and
also you get the food that you want more.


This is Knapsack Problem , and the calorie and other stuff are constraints .

In the module we have a python script Food , i.e to make our life better and to 
Structure the code also .

Then we have another script Optimization in which the problem is implemented.
